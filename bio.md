NAME:
Eric Miller

BIO:
Hi, my name is Eric. I work and reside in the Seattle Washington area 
where I am currently employed as an exporter for an aerospace company.
My background is in Japanese language, and I used to live in Tokyo until 
mid-2013 when I moved back to the United States.

PROGRAMMING BACKGROUND:
I actually first started programming when I began the OSU post-bacc 
program last year. Currently I am on the 4th quarter of a 2 year track.
Most of my experience is in the C languages, although I am excited to
learn about HTML and other web-based programming.

My favorite project was the final for CS 161 where I made a text based
adventure game with an inventory system in the spirit of 'Zork'.
